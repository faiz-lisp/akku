Akku.scm is a language package manager for Scheme. It grabs hold of
code and vigorously shakes it until it behaves properly.

* Separately declare your dependencies and locked versions.
* One command to install everything needed for a project.
* Project-based, installs your locked dependencies to a single library
  directory.
* Scan repositories for R6RS libraries, even multiple per file, and
  copy them to the right file paths for any supported Scheme.
* Resolve all files needed for compilation and scan them for license
  notices.

More words: [Introduction to Akku.scm](https://weinholt.se/articles/introduction-to-akku-scm/).

## Dependencies

Akku.scm currently requires the git and curl programs. Publishing
requires GnuPG. It has only been tested on GNU/Linux systems.
Assistance in porting is very welcome.

## Installation

There are two options:

 - Download, unpack and run the binary installer
   from [GitHub](https://github.com/weinholt/akku/releases). Pre-built
   versions are available for GNU/Linux amd64. The installation is
   completely contained to `~/.akku`.

 - Download the source bundle
   from [GitHub](https://github.com/weinholt/akku/releases) (files
   ending with `.src.tar.xz`). This version is a little slower to
   start, because it is recompiled each time, but it may run on more
   types of systems. It requires Chez Scheme 9.5 or later.

Please remember to verify the OpenPGP signatures. The releases are
signed with [E33E61A2E9B8C3A2][key].

## Usage

Here's a high level view of how to get started:

 - Create a new directory for your project or go to your existing
   project directory.
 - Run `akku list` to list the packages (`akku update` downloads the
   package index).
 - Run `akku install <pkg>` to install a named package. This also
   installs the code in your current directory into `.akku`.
 - Run `source .akku/bin/activate` (in bash) to prepare the
   environment for the programs and libraries in `.akku`.

The installed libraries and programs should now be available to you,
assuming you use one of these Schemes: Chez Scheme, GNU Guile (with
R6RS settings), Ikarus, Mosh, Racket (plt-r6rs), Sagittarius, Vicare
or Ypsilon.
